#  AI Voice Assistant (Browser-Based Web App)

This is a simple voice-enabled document assistant built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and the **Web Speech API**.  
It helps users create, read aloud, and delete documents using only their voice — all inside the browser.

-  Delete documents via voice commands

##  How to Use

1. **Open the app in Google Chrome or Edge**
2. Use the buttons or speak commands
3. Speak clearly — the assistant listens and types for you
4. Save your document or read/delete an existing one

>  Everything runs in the browser. No backend or installation needed.
